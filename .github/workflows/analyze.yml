# Custom static analysis pipeline. Intentionally overlaps with ci.yml in some
# areas (e.g. golangci-lint) because ci.yml is owned by Grafana plugin tooling
# and exists for plugin conformance, not general code quality.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   Add CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN as a repo secret (from https://app.cachix.org/cache/aj-welch)
